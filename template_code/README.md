# South Sudan Project 
## Code description
You are provided with two notebooks and the necessary data to help you start the South Sudan project. First, run _topic_modelling.ipynb_. In this notebook, a BERTopic model is fit on _articles_summary_cleaned.csv_, then four categories/keywords (hunger, refugees, humanitarian, and conflict) are defined. These categories are used for categorising articles (or none if the article doesnâ€™t match any of the categories) and thus creating features from the news articles. Secondly, run the _predictions.ipynb_ notebook for some very basic data exploration, along with fitting several linear models on the data, with- and without the news features. The notebook uses the _food_crises_cleaned.csv_ dataset and the csv file obtained from the  _topic_modelling.ipynb_ notebook.

## Requirements
To install the requirements open Terminal (macOS)/Command Prompt (Windows) and run pip install -r requirements.txt. If you create a new environment in PyCharm, an icon should appear to install requirements. The code runs with Python 3.9.16.

Required libraries:
- bertopic == 0.15.0 
- pandas == 1.4.4 
- geopandas == 0.13.2 
- matplotlib == 3.7.2 
- seaborn == 0.12.2
- statsmodels == 0.14.0 

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the notebooks, try the following:
- check that you have all the necessary libraries installed and the correct versions of them
- check your Python version. In principle, the code should work with any Python versions higher than 3.9.16. If this is not the case, create a virtual environment that uses Python 3.9.16.
